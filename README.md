🥁 HTML Drum Kit

Overview :

The HTML Drum Kit is a fun, interactive web project that lets you play different drum sounds by pressing keyboard keys or clicking on the drum buttons on your screen. It’s a great way to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while creating an engaging musical experience.


🎯 Features :

Click on-screen drum buttons to play sounds.

Visual feedback: buttons animate when pressed.

Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile.



🛠️ Technologies Used :

HTML – For the structure of the drum kit.

JavaScript – To handle key presses and play sounds.

Audio Files – Drum sounds (kick, snare, hi-hat, toms, crash).
